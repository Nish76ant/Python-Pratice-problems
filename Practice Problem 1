#Python Practice Problem 2
#Divide The Apples
#Harry potter has got n number of apples .Harry has some students amont whom , he wants to distibute
#the apple these n number of apples are provided to harry by his friend and he can request for
#few more or few less apple,you need to print wheather a number in range mn to mx is a divisor of n or not
#input - take input n ,mn and mx from the user
#output
#print whether the numbers b/w mn and mx are divisor of n or not
#if mn = mx show that this is not the range and mn is eqal to mx show the result for that number
#Example if n is 20 and mn=2 and mx = 5
#2 is a divior of 20
#3 is not a divisor of 20
#-------
#5 is a not divisor of 20

apples = int(input('Enter the number of apples \n'))
mn = int(input('Enter the minimum numbers to check \n'))
mx = int(input('Enter the maximum numbers to check \n'))

for i in range(mn,mx+1):
    if apples%i == 0:
        print(f"{i} is a divisor of {apples}")
    else:
        print(f"{i} is not a divisor of {apples}")  

if mn == mx:
    print('Make sure entered mn,mx should be not eqal')
