# Your age in 2019

# take input or age from the user year of birth
# Determine age or year
# and tell them when will they turn 100 years old
# don't use any type of module

# they can then optionally provide a year and your program must tell their age in particular year.

# you should be handling all sorts of errors like
# You are not yet born
# You seem to be the oldest person alive
# you can handle any other error if possible
