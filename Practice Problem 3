#Foods and Calories
"""
you visit a resturant called Code with Nishant
and fooditems in this restaurant
food items in this restaurant are sorted based on their amount of calories
you have to reverse this list of food items and their calories
you have to use following three methods to reverse a list
1.inbuilt method of python
2.listname [::1]
3.swapping first element with last one and second elements with second last one and so on..
if these all method give same output then print this list

Example - 
input - Take a list as a input from the user.
[5,4,1]
output - [1,4,5]
[1,4,5]
[1,4,5]
All the three method will gives same results
"""
#Take the size of the list from the user
print('Enter the numbers of the list one by one \n')
size = int(input('Enter size of list \n'))
#Intialize a blank list
mylist = []
for i in range(size):
    mylist.append(int(input('Enter list element \n')))
print(f'your list is {mylist} \n')    

reverse1 = mylist[:]
reverse1.reverse()

reverse2 = mylist[::-1]

print(f'my First reverse list of {mylist} is {reverse1} \n')
print(f"my Second reversed list of {mylist} is {reverse2} \n")

reverse3 = mylist[:]
for i in range(len(reverse3)//2):
    reverse3[i],reverse3[len(reverse3)-i-1] = reverse3[len(reverse3)-i-1],reverse3[i]
    print(f'the reversed list at i = {i} is {reverse3}')

print(f"My third reversed list of my {mylist} is {reverse3}")

if reverse1 == reverse2 and reverse2 == reverse3:
    print("All three method gives same results")
